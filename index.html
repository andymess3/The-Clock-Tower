O new light from the skies! O reason for my praise!

								O Holy One, in who light and shadows we have journeyed throughout this day, give us now a peaceful night and when our lives have ripened, a happy death! Let us be watchful and vigilant because the enemies of the soul prowl about looking for opportune moments to discourage us. Remember then, with confidence, the powerful and strong spiritual searchlight of faith and the magic light within. Let us place ourselves in the protective care of the angels and into the cupped hands of the Divine. Take a momemtn to let these images embrace you. Use the following Examen of Consciousness as a careful reflection of your day, or create your own:<br><br>- Have I been a good memory in anyone's life today?<br>- Have the ears of my heart opened to the voice of God?<br>- Have the ears of my heart opened to the needs of my sisters and brothers?<br>- Have the eyes of my heart beheld the Divine face in all created things?<br>- What do I know, but live as though I do not know?<br>- Have I been a good student of the hours today?<br>- How have I affected the quality of this day?<br>- Hvae I been blind or deaf to the blessing of the day?<br>- Is there anyone, including myself, whom I need to forgive?<br>- When did I experience my heart opening wide today?<br>- Have I worked with joy or drudgery?<br>-Have I waited with grace or with impatience?<br> What is the one thing in my life that is standing on tip-toe crying, 'May I have your attention please?' What needs my attention?
